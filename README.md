# SALES-PREDICTION
In this project, I analyzed the sales data for more than 8,000 different oulets. I made sales predictions in the various outlets based on their year of establishment, the type of outlet they represent, their year of establishment and the kind of item sold.

#### Visualizations
In this analysis, the missing data were visualized using missingno and also the correlation of the target variable to the features was visualized using heatmap

The above figure shows the missing data in the sales prediction project

The second figure shows the relationships between the target variable (Item_Outlet_Sales) and the features variables

## Model
Regressions algorithms that were used for this project 
 - dummy regressor
 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Bagged Tree
 - Random Forest

## Describe your final model
Random forest model performs well more than the four algorithms

## Report the most important metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), R-Squared (R2):
These were the metrics that was used for the project. However I considered the RMSE and R2 for model built to determine the best model

## Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem
Root Mean Squared Error: The lower the error scores for RMSE, the better the prediction of sales, 
R-Squared: The more the R2, the more the people are ready to buy the sales

## Recommendations:
Since Random Forest algorithm was the one that performs well, it will be advisable to deployed it
