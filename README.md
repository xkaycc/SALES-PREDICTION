# SALES-PREDICTION
In this project, I analyzed the sales data for more than 8,000 different oulets. I made sales predictions in the various outlets based on their year of establishment, the type of outlet they represent, their year of establishment and the kind of item sold.

The second visualization shows the relationships between the target variable (Item_Outlet_Sales) and the features variables

## Model
Regressions models that was used for this project were 
 - dummy regressor
 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Bagged Tree
 - Random Forest

## Describe your final model
Random forest model performs well more than the four algorithms

## Report the most important metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), R-Squared (R2):
These were the metrics that were used for the project. However I considered the RMSE and R2 for model built

## Refer to the metrics to describe how well the model would solve the business problem
Root Mean Squared Error: The lower the error scores for RMSE, the better the prediction, 
R-Squared: The more the R2, the better the prediction

## Recommendations:
Since Random Forest algorithm was the one that performs well, it will advisable it is deployed
